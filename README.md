# NIP Scripts

View and run NIP scripts from the sidebar

# Demo

![NIP Scripts](https://github.com/RopePy/vscode-nip-scripts/raw/master/media/demo.gif "Demo")


# Usage

Open the NIP SCRIPTS section in the sidebar to view all 
scripts in the projects nip.json file. Click on one 
to start it in the console. Each instance gets its own 
console tab based on the script name, so running multiple 
scripts at the same time is no problem.

## Configuration

{
  ...
  "nip-scripts.showStartNotification": false   // Disables dropdown notification
  ...
}

## Development

- Open this example in VS Code
- `npm install`
- `npm run compile`
- `F5` to start debugging
